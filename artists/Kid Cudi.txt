i'm risking my soul attack now i'm heard all over the map only rule of thumb it don't really matter just where you from all that really matter is where you're gon go maybe upstate for some but you can't rule out these claps for gun  second chances given out for some all you gotta do is take advantage so maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage been pimpin you should think about marriage until then get it then find yourself and let's begin im'a tell you how in a minute im'a show you how i be livin from a long time ago a young nigga he was timid now i'm zone and see things so vivid hide my soul nah homie not even im'a zone out till i lose feeling remember im'a be gone way past november even stay up there up there floatin floatin hopin when i'm gone it feels like ooooooh i'm

in cleveland city we ride around greetin my niggas wit dap and pounds so if i fall i won't hit the ground these are the things that'll make me smile knowin this blunt might burn a while i keep myself so lifted i am accustomed to new heights i feel perfect though they think it's worthless see without my flight man everybody wanna be a critic i have my life and i will live it shut your mouth before i fuck it ha my jokes they will love it if i'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans more than likely i am fadin man doin other shit if everywhere you go niggas ain't just standin round hatin so my
