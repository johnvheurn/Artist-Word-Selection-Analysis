his back against the wall nigga fought like us damn poor isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy what's his father name shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him damn near impossible only men can raise men he was his own man not even him could save him he put his faith in the 38 in his waist but when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate end up dead before 38 and a that's the life of what's raised by a winter it's a cold world old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away isyss life just ended on that rainy day when she got the news her boy body could be viewed down at the city mourge open the drawer saw em nude her addiction grew prescription drugs dipped in brew angel dust dipped in whoo she slipped into her own fantasy world had her self pregnant by different dude but reality bites and this is her life he wasn't really her husband though he called her wife it was just this night when the moon was full and the stars was just right and the dress was real tight and it sounded like lisa lisa i wonder if i take you home will you still love me after this night mike was the hard head from around the way that she wanted all her life shit she wanted all the hype used to hold on tight when they wheelied on the bike he was a willie all her life he wasn't really the one to like it was a dude named shi who would really treat her right he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life but isyss liked this broad way life she loved the gucci sneakers the red green and white hanging out the window when she first seen em fight so turned on that she had to shower twice how ironic it would be some fight that would turn it to a homicide that would alter their life see mike at 32 was still on the seen he had a son 15 that he never saw twice sure he saw him as an infant but he disowned him like if that was my son he would look much different see i'm light skinned and that baby there's dark so it's momma's baby poppa's maybe mike was still crazy out there running the streets had his old reliable 38 gun in his reach he spent 14 years him and isyss aint speak he runnin around like life is a peach till one day he approached this thug that had a mean mug and he looked so familiar that he called um young cuz told em get off the strip but the boy aint budge instead he pulled out a newer 38 snug he clearly had to drop but the boy just paused it was something in this mans face he knew he seen before it's like looking in the mirror seeing his self more mature he took it as a sign from the almighty lord you know what they say about he who hesitates at war what's that he who hesitates is lost he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank the old man didn't think he just followed his instinct six shots into his kin out of the gun
