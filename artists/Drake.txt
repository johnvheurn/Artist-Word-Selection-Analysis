other end of the shade most times it's just somebody that's underage that's probably just alone and afraid and lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain i always hear people complain about the place that they live that all the people here fake and they got nothin to give cause they been starin at somebody else's version of shi that makes another city seem more excitin than it is i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome then she finally got to rome and all she did was post pictures for people at home cause all that mattered was impressin everybody she's known i know another girl that's cryin out for help but her latest caption is leave me alone i know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone i know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown to post later and make it look like she still on the go look at the way we live i wasn't hidin my kid from the world i was hidin the world from my kid from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate until you starin at your seed you can never relate breakin news in my life i don't run to the blogs the only ones i wanna tell are the ones i can call they always ask why let the story run if it's false you know a wise man once said nothin at all i'm exhausted and drained i can't even pretend all these people takin miles when you give em an inch all these followers but who gon follow me to the
