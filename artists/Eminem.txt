but i'm only going to get this one chance something's wrong i can feel it for six minutes slim shady you're on just a feeling i've got like something's about to happen but i don't know what if that means what i think it means we're in trouble big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say i'm not taking any chances you are just what the doc ordered all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box got a fat knot from that rap profit made a livin and a killin off it ever since bill clinton was still in office with monica lewinsky feeling on his nutsack i'm an mc still as honest but as rude and as indecent as all hell syllables skill-a-holic kill em all with this flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop you don't really wanna get into a pissin match with this rappity-rap packin a mac in the back of the ac backpack rap crap yap-yap yackety-yack and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicing that i'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow all i do is drop f-bombs everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like i have got well to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew mc's get taken to school with this music cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz 2pac n.w.a cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position to meet run-d.m.c and induct them into the mothafuckin rock n roll hall of fame even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame you're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place looking boy i get a hell yeah from dre looking boy get outta my face looking boy basically boy you're never gonna be capable of keeping up dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god kneel before general zod this planet's krypton no asgard asgard so you be thor and i'll be odin you rodent i'm omnipotent let off then i'm reloading immediately with these bombs i'm toting and i should not be woken i'm the walking dead but i'm just a talking head a zombie floating but i got your mom deep throating i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothing in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak-47 a revolver and a nine see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin into an immortal coming through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singing to a man while they played piano man oh man that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed j.j fad uh summa-lumma dooma-lumma you assuming i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating cause i know the way to get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hip-hop it's pop cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurting you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ungh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongue-in-cheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'm asleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip abroad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted one moment would you capture it or just let it slip there's

intentionally just to diss you and what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too i say that shit just clowning dog c'mon  how fucked up is you you got some issues stan i think you need some counseling to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some and what's this shit about us meant to be together that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other i really think you and your girlfriend need each other or maybe you just need to treat her better i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin just fine if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan i just don't want you to do some crazy shit i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to come to think about his name was it was you damn and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up but you got to search within you and try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse til the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killing em cause when i am not then i'mma stop penning em and i am not hip-hop and i'm just not eminem subliminal thoughts when i'mma stop sending em women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom adrenalin shots the penicillin could not get the illing to stop amoxicillin's just not real enough the criminal cop-killing hip hop villain a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners you're coming with me feel it or not you're gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us you hear it a lot lyrics to shock is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzing up for shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck till my legs give out can't shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps i'mma rip this shit till my bone collapse till the roof comes off till the lights go out till my legs give out can't shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps i'mma rip this shit till my bone collapse when you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit this is your moment and every single minute you spend tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end because i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in it goes reggie jay-z 2pac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy so when i'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me that's why you see me walking round like nothing's bothering me even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me you hate it but you know respect you got to give me the press's wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me till my legs give out can't shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps i'mma rip this shit till my bone collapse till the roof comes off till the lights go out till my legs give out can't shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps i'mma rip this shit till my bone collapse what is he thinking how not to go against me smart and it's absurd how people hang on every word i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm an addict i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers but i don't want to go forth and back in constant battles the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers so this is like a full blown attack i'm launching at em the track is on some battling raps who want some static cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest so till my legs give out can't shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps i'mma rip this shit till my bone collapse till the roof comes off till the lights go out till my legs give out can't shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps i'mma rip this shit till my bone collapse until the roof the roof comes off the roof comes off until my legs until my legs give out from underneath me feels like no one can beat me i've been too long on my own everybody has a private world where they can be alone are you calling me are you reaching out for me i'm reaching out for you if i could just get over this hump but i need something to pull me out this dump i took my bruises took my lumps fell down and i got right back up but i need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up i don't know how or why or when i ended up in this position i'm in i'm starting to feel distant again so i decided just to pick this pen up and try to make an attempt to vent but i just can't admit or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap ineed a new outlet i know some shit's so hard to swallow and i just can't sit back and wallow in my own sorrow but i know one fact i'll be one tough act to follow one tough act to follow i'll be one tough act to follow here today gone tomorrow but you have to walk a thousand miles what it's like to be me i'll be you let's trade shoes just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain you feel mine go inside each other's mind just to see what we find look at shit through each other's eyes but don't let em say you ain't beautiful oh oh they can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh so don't let em say you ain't beautiful oh oh they can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh everything is so tense and gloom i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature in the room just as soon as i walk in it's like all eyes on me so i try to avoid any eye contact cause if i do that then it opens a door for conversation like i want that i'm not looking for extra attention i just want to be just like you blend in with the rest of the room maybe just point me to the closest restroom i don't need no fucking man servant trying to follow me around and wipe my ass laugh at every single joke i crack and half of them ain't even funny like ah marshall you're so funny man you should be a comedian god damn unfortunately i am but i just hide behind the tears of a clown so why don't you all sit down listen to the tale i'm about to tell hell we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles what it's like to be me i'll be you let's trade shoes just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain you feel mine go inside each other's minds just to see what we find look at shit through each other's eyes but don't let em say you ain't beautiful oh oh they can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh so don't let em say you ain't beautiful oh oh they can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh we have to take these cards ourselves and flip them don't expect no help now i could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned or take this situation in which i'm placed in and get up and get my own i was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did i just wanted to fit in at every single place every school i went i dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid aunt edna always told me keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that meanwhile i'm just standin there holdin my tongue tryna talk like this til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old i learned my lesson then cause i wasn't tryna impress my friends no mo but i already told you my whole life story not just based on my description cause where you see it from where you're sitting is probably 110 different i guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least what size you wear i wear tens let's see if you can fit your feet what it's like to be me i'll be you let's trade shoes just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain you feel mine go inside each other's mind just to see what we find look at shit through each other's eyes but don't let em say you ain't beautiful oh oh they can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh so don't let em say you ain't beautiful oh oh they can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh i've been too long on my own everybody has a private world where they can be alone are

i ever had a multi-platinum selling cd i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye no i don't on second thought i just fucking wished he would die i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leaving her side even if i hated kim i grit my teeth and i'd try to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake i maybe made some mistakes what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets outta that gun cause i'da killed him shit i would've shot kim and him both it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show i never meant to hurt you i'm cleaning out my closet one more time i said i'm sorry momma i never meant to hurt you i never meant to make you cry but tonight i'm cleaning out my closet take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing but put yourself in my position just try to envision witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing going through public housing systems victim of munchhausen's syndrome my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach doesn't it wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma but guess what you're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely and nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony and hailie's getting so big now you should see her she's beautiful see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong bitch do your song  keep telling yourself that you was a mom but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get you selfish bitch i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me well guess what i am dead  dead to you as can be i never
