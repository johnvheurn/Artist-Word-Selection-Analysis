rockville maryland 7 36 a.m where a biracial baby was born to a black father and a white mother father that wasn't there addicted to crack cocaine alcohol and various other drugs same as his mom way way back so i'm gonna tell you about that right and i'm gonna tell you about how all this young boy ever wanted was happiness all he ever wanted was positivity all he ever wanted to do was entertain and this boy went through hell you gotta understand his mother was racist which is crazy cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist like bitch that don't make no sense but it is what it is you know he grew up her callin him a nigger the kids at school callin him a cracker identifying as black looking as white being told what you can or can't be this kid went through everything he went through he saw narcotics in the household violence murderers drug dealers he was kidnapped there was crazy shit that happened to this kid and he persevered while the whole world said what they said said you wouldn't be shit you ain't gon be nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothing and i and he he said fuck that i'ma persevere and that's why the message is always peace love and positivity see he always saw things from two sides he always saw things from two sides he always knew that the message everybody was born equal regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation he knew that because he saw that take it back take it way back take it way because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated and that did not know and he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know these people that are ignorant that cannot see the bigger picture that must fight and kill and murder each other but once again all he ever wanted to do was spread a message of equality for every man woman and child regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first now imagine this child growing up and seeing the craziest shit being a part of the craziest shit running around with the wrong people running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and and all this because he didn't know he didn't know but he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right and he knew that he needed to get away from it now i want you to also imagine that at 17 years old this child okay leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings and then he would then come home to about eight or nine hours of sleep but spend four five six hours of that working on music persevering grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror and pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people just chanting his name hoping that it would happen but the but the but the world said no mothafucka little mothafucka no-no no-no no-no no-no ya nigga ya cracka ya white boy ya black mothafucka no-no take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first and he said fuck that he said peace love and positivity he said equality for all man regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah now i want you to also imagine people telling him that he did not live this life you just a white boy you ain't never experienced that shit you from gaithersburg maryland nothing happens there oh no no we know we weren't there we didn't live with you we didn't live in your section 8 household we didn't live with the narcotics and violence in your household we just saw it from the outside outside outside outside outside outside outside outside and since you white you gotta have money right take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first black man and this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was wasn't and would never be take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first black and that man is here today proud a lover of all human beings regardless of race religion color creed sexual orientation yeah yeah and he's here to say even though we're all born and created equal we are not treated equally there's extremists on every side and you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe as long as they're not hurtin anybody you can believe they're going to hell you can believe it's not right you can believe you're superior fine just stop killing each other what shit hq

thought the album was finished but i keep writing shit it's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged no matter what happens everything ain't gon be the same the incredible album what an incredible outcome i grip the mic and then talk to the people like i'm malcolm i used to think the fame and money was the motivation until i toured the world and met the people face to face and understood that the power was harnessed in that basement it ain't about the money and notoriety it's about the people and making a difference in society but don't get it twisted this life i'm living is like a movie the godfather the goodfella wielding an uzi one with the people if the people is wondering who's he same level the same rebel that never settled pullin strings like geppeto who overcame the ghetto and i know you wrote me and i still ain't answered cause shit is different now it's forced upon me different stances i used to spend all my time conversing with you but now i write this song to let you know i'm hurting with you shit is too big but let's be honest man it's kinda bittersweet besides the shows and meet and greets y'all only see me on the street and even then that shit is rareâi just don't go outside cause honestly i don't fuck with this world i'd rather hide that misconception cause i rap i must be filled with pride shit i ain't perfect if you heard different then someone lied people in my ear telling me talk that shit actions speak louder than words i'd rather walk that shit since the first album i'm one of the highest earners on the label

somehow someway in the heart of hollywood i stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch star wars when suddenly i was engulfed with fear and panic as my body began to fade in this moment my mind was full of clarity but my body insisted it was in danger i looked around and i told myself i was safe i was fine but i was convinced that something was wrong before i knew it i felt as though i was going to fall and fade away my body grew weak and soon enough i found myself in a hospital bed being told what i went through was anxiety i refused to believe this story i searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me i began to feel detached from reality i felt as though i was seeing the world through a glass i got blood work done analysis of my mind and body to no avail the doctor said it was anxiety but how could it be anxiety how could anxiety make me physically feel off balance how could anxiety make me feel as though i was fading from this world and on the brink of death derealization the sense of being out of one's body i'm not here i'm not me i'm not real nothing is nothing but this feeling of panic nobody understands nobody knows the sufferings this physical feeling it can't be anxiety it can't or can it can it in fact be the mind controlling the body yeah of course i'm so in control of my mind and my body but i'm subconsciously forcing myself into a state of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind i am unhappy not with life but with this feeling i am scared i am human i am a man but i look in the mirror and i see a child i am an adult who recognize grown ups don't really know shit and they never did and it scares me cause now i'm just a grown up who doesn't know shit but one thing is i do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me no no this feeling this anxiety is nothing i have anxiety just like you the person i wrote this for and together we will overcome this feeling we will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge that we are alive and any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted we will rejoice in this gift that is life we will rejoice in this day that we have been given we will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves starting with mental health we will accept ourselves as we are and we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror we will accept ourselves and live with anxiety everybody know i be yeah yeah old girl wanna fuck me yeah she fine i'ma
