find nothing but trouble in my life i'm fortunate you believe in a dream this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive everybody's a victim in my eyes when i ride it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering get em i got em and i ain't give a fuck that same mentality that told my brother not to duck in actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if i'll ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child i'm proud and well devoted this piru shit been in me forever so forever i'mma push it wherever whenever and i love you cause you love my brother like you did just

nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit and i'mma need that forty dollars even if i gotta fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot gonzales park i'm followed by a married man a father of three my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with e's he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week this is the life of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes i run away and never do miss em see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then i'll probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin then you probably need to beat her that's how i was taught three niggas in one room first time i was tossed and i'm exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain if you can't fit the pumps i walk in i'll wait your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure i'm not in the song cause i don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great a doctor's approval is a waste of time i know i'm straight i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away i'll never fade away i'll never fade away i know my fate and i'm on the grind for this cake i'mma

said when the lights shut off and it's my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passing away if it's today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline reeking the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if i'm doomed may the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wondering when i'mma rest and you're right your brother was a brother to me and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak of something that's realer than the tv screen by any means wasn't trying to offend or come between her personal life i was like it need to be told cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly what'd happen if i ain't continued rappin or steady being distracted by money drugs and four fives i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day you'll be strong fighting for your rights even when you're wrong and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone am i worth it did i put enough work in promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and

in the hotel room i didn't wanna self destruct the evils of lucy was all around me so i went running for answers until i came home but that didn't stop survivor's guilt going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned or maybe how a-1 my foundation was but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word was respect just because you wore a different gang color than mine's doesn't mean i can't respect you as a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us but i don't know i'm no mortal man maybe i'm just another nigga i was gonna call it another nigga but it ain't really a poem i just felt like it's something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground what you mean bout that what the ground represent its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts he's trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city the result wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same pac pac pac cause you taught me to smoking weed with you cause you taught me to i'm living but really though it's never enough 10 milli on that's a must living in california
